## Objective
This repository holds the files neccessary for generating a native tablet application for the DataTackle User Interface.

## Dependencies

Please ensure these software are installed on your computer:

- Node.js
- Xcode for running the iOS Simulator (If you are developing from a Windows or a Linux machine, you will need a physical iOS device for testing)
	- View this page for assistance: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

These values pertain to the PostgreSQL database you are attempting to connect to, either the local database instance or the cloud hosted database. See the [RST Database Repo](https://github.com/SRJPE/rst-database) for details on these values.

`REACT_APP_BASE_URL`  : This is the URL of the server you have setup to make HTTP requests, either locally or to a cloud server.

Current Azure B2C Configuration Environmental Variables:
- `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`

- `REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET_VALUE`

- `REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET_ID`

- These environment variables, codebase, and logic may require changing if utilizing an authentication and authorization service other than Azure AD B2C

## Setup

### Local Development using Expo Go and iOS Simulator
- Run `npm install` to install all package dependencies. If that fails, attempt running `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- Run `npm start` to initiate the development client
- In the terminal, ensure the client is set to using Expo Go
![Terminal Screenshot](https://rstmarkdownimages.blob.core.windows.net/markdown-images/Screenshot%202024-07-03%20at%209.08.16%20AM.png)

- Press `i` on your keyboard to initiate the iOS simulator
- This will launch the application in the Simulator software

### Development Build

### Native Application Build

### Authentication
- This application utilizes the Azure AD B2C authentication service, which requires users to sign in before accessing the application.

- You will need to setup an Azure AD B2C service and user accounts within the Azure portal and then configure the environmental variables to match the values generated by Azure. If you do not intend to replicate the Azure AD B2C flow, you will need to refactor the codebase to meet the requirements of the authentication service you choose.

## Interacting with the Server and Database
Please visit the GitHub repositories for the Server and Database to access setup instructions for those portions of the application.
